<h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>We've created an application which allows users to use style transfer on their own images.</p>
<h4>What is Style Transfer?</h4>
<p>It's used to transfer the style of one image onto another. In our application, we transfer the style of artwork onto selfies.</p>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>A convolutional neural network is trained to produce images somewhere between the Content Image and the Style Image.</p>
<p>This application uses an existing implementation which can be found <a href='https://github.com/abhiskk/fast-neural-style'>here</a>.</p>
